# werf guides

[werf guides](https://werf.io/guides/) are in-depth free online tutorials to learn
how you can use [werf CI/CD tool](https://werf.io/) to depoy your apps to Kubernetes.

These guides will work even for those who have no experience with Kubernetes. Combining
the theory and practice of development (Dev) and operation (Ops), they will guide you
step by step from learning the basics of werf and Kubernetes to fully benefit
from running highly available apps in K8s clusters.

werf guides provide instructions for different programming languages/frameworks
including:
* JavaScript (Node.js),
* Java (Spring Boot),
* Python (Django),
* Go,
* Ruby (Ruby on Rails),
* PHP (Laravel).

All guides' articles are currently available in two languages, English & Russian.
