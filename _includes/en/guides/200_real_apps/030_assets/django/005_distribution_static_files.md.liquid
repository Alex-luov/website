Django has no built-in means to distribute static files in a production environment. The best way to do this is to use a reverse proxy like NGINX.

There are several ways to hide a Django application behind a reverse proxy in Kubernetes. We will use a popular and simple one, which nevertheless scales well. In it, an NGINX container (in the same Pod) runs in front of each application container and proxies all requests except for static file requests into the application. The NGINX container then reads the static files and serves them to the client.
