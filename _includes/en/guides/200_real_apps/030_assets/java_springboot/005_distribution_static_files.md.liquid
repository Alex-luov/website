Currently, Spring Boot serves static files using built-in tools. Using a reverse proxy like NGINX is a more efficient and robust approach. This is because the reverse proxy distributes static files much more efficiently than Spring Boot.

There are several ways to deploy the Spring Boot application behind the reverse proxy in Kubernetes. We will use a popular and straightforward method that nevertheless scales well. As part of it, the NGINX container is deployed to each Pod with the Spring Boot container. This auxiliary container serves as a proxy for all requests except for static file requests. The NGINX container is responsible for the distribution of static files.
