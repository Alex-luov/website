To do this, we used [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) and created an application template with the following parameters:

* Maven project — Maven is used as the project build automation tool;
* Spring Boot version — 2.6.1;
* Language — select Java as the development language;
* Java version — 11;
* Package format — `*.jar`;
* Select Spring Web in the dependencies (it is required for a RESTful service).
