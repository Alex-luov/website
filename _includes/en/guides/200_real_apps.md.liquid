In this chapter, we will start with a {{ page.framework_name }} application with the same feature set as the application from the previous section.

We will gradually add new functionality to it with each new chapter, eventually ending up with an app resembling the real-life one that incorporates many of the best practices for building, deploying an application, and organizing its structure. We'll set up application logging and learn how to serve static files, use the database, work with files and secrets, and configure the application.
